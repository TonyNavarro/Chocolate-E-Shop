# Chocolate-E-Shop
A website to present/inform about a product (chocolates). This project has the objectives of learning and improve the programming and planning (as well as many other skills) of the users involve on it. Moreover, I must mention the fact that this webpage will be given to a particular client. Finally, dont forget to enjoy when you participate in this project!

I am Tony Navarro, currently studying Software Engineering at the university. Although I started two years ago, I managed to get some web development skills during lessons. However, At the start of the second year, this module was left behind... but not my desire and enthusiasm of learning HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT in order to develop a website. Throughout these 3 year, although the course will touch some other programming languages such as PHP, I will be focusing more on Java. Therefore, my enthusiasm to create an app for my needs is increasing! I hope this project will be quite an adventure, learning new concepts, different point of views...in short, a new experience.
